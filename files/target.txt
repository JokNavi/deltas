Version 2 (with slight logical changes):
In a small village perched at the base of a looming mountain, a modest blacksmith named Thomas worked tirelessly day in and day out. 
He was celebrated across the region for his extraordinary skill, and folks traveled from afar to commission him for their weapons and tools.
The entire village relied on Thomas for their sustenance, and he was at peace with his unassuming yet rewarding existence.
